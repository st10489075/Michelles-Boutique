        <h3>Our History</h3>
        <p>Michelle’s boutique is owned and funded by Michelle Ramakgolo in 2022 in a small back-room at her mother’s house
        in Mankweng Turflop. She loves looking pretty by always making sure that her nails, hair and eye lashes are on point,
        she goes with the say that “when you look good, you feel good”.
        She started by practicing these personal grooming on her mother, sisters, aunties and her close friends
        and soon after, her business grew and she started falling with beauty stuff even more because of the compliments she get from society.
        In 2024 she bought her first shop in Polokwane and that is when she knew of her talent.
        Michelle want to have a website where she can upload her work, attract new clients and earn more trust so she make profit.
        She believes that women should embrace their beauty and wear their hair as crowns.
        She also offers training as beautician to empower women into becoming independent and open more boutiques
        so that she can be easily accessible in different locations.
        Her target market is every lady/woman who loves looking pretty and those who want to make a living but do not know where to start.
        Her doors are open to everyone who is interested in persuing  career in beauty.
